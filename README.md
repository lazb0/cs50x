## Week 0 - Scratch
Just create scratch code with following specifications:
- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short).

I have decided to make copy of cookie clicker. The Banana Clicker the scratch game where you click the big banana to get more bananas to spent. With the bananas you can buy monkeys, that produce you more bananas. I made it so it meets the specification, though it could be more complex.
